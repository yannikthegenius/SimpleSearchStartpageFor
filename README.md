This extension will add a context menu entry to search for selected text using Startpage. Useful for when your default search engine is an alternative like DuckDuckGo but you still want to be able to easily search with Startpage.

Tested on Firefox only.





This is a fork from Aaron-P's "SimpleSearchGoogleFor":

I replaced Google with Startpage as well as updated the icon.svg to represent a Startpage icon.
